# Guess My Number ðŸ¤“

## Overview & Description

Author : rennfurukawa

My friend said if i can *guess* the right number, he will give me something. 
Can you help me?

## Hints

Use the same *seed* while randomize the number

## TL;DR

- Crack the rand() function with the same seed (1337) 
- Because rand() is executed once, the value is always same
- Calculate the exact key with the known value (random & 0xcafebabe)
- Use XOR to recover key

## Exploitation

We were given the binary **guessmynumber**, decompile it to ghidra and we see there is vuln() function as the main program

I already change the variable name, so we can conclude that

- Key is our input
- If our input XOR-ed with random value + 1337331 then equal to **0xcafebabe**, we can print the flag

### Cracking rand() with known seed 

So the idea is to find the random value that program generated and calculate the exact key

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
	srand(1337);
	printf("%d\n",rand());
}
```

Because the program executed rand() once, the **randomize** value doesn't change, so we clearly know that the server generated same value as we did

### Calculating key using reversible XOR

After we find the random number, we need to add it with **1337331**, and now the need to calculate the **key**

From this we can calculate the key, because we already know the random value and the result of XOR operation

So lets pretend that :
```
A = Key

B = (Random Number + 1337331) 

C = 0xcafebabe 
```

Because XOR is **reversible**, we can recover A (key) from this equation

$$A \oplus B = C$$ 

$$B \oplus C = A$$

After we find the exact key, we can send it to server and get the flag !

```python
from pwn import *
import ctypes

libc = ctypes.CDLL("/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6")
elf = context.binary = ELF("../src/guessmynumber/guess")

def conn():
    if args.REMOTE:
        p = remote("127.0.0.1", 7331)
    else:
        p = process(elf.path)
    return p

p = conn()

libc.srand(1337)

random = libc.rand()
print(random)

pay = random + 1337331 ^ 0xcafebabe

p.sendline(str(pay))

p.interactive()
```
